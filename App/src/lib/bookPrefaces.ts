      "The book's Aramaic is 'Imperial Aramaic' of the 6th–4th centuries BC, not the later Aramaic of the Maccabean period. The linguistic evidence supports an early date (K.A. Kitchen, R.D. Wilson).",
      "Josephus (Antiquities 11.8.5) records that Alexander the Great was shown the book of Daniel (which predicted the fall of Persia), and this caused him to honor the Jews — treating it as a recognized book by the 4th century BC, before any Maccabean date is possible.",
      "The Septuagint (LXX) translation of Daniel dates to c. 100–150 BC, implying the book was in recognized circulation well before a Maccabean origin could gain canonical standing.",
      "The four-empire scheme (Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, Roman) fits a 6th-century perspective naturally. A Maccabean author would likely have made Antiochus IV Epiphanes the ultimate villain, but Daniel's visions point beyond him to a greater eschatological enemy.",

    summary: "Hebrews is the NT's most sustained argument for the supremacy of Christ — the final, perfect High Priest whose sacrifice fulfills and supersedes all of the Mosaic system. Written to Jewish Christians tempted to revert to Judaism, it demonstrates that Jesus is greater than angels, Moses, Joshua, Aaron, and the Levitical covenant.",
    themes: ["The supremacy of Christ over all", "The better covenant, better sacrifice, better High Priest", "Faith as forward-looking trust in God's promises (ch. 11)", "The danger of apostasy — do not drift", "Sabbath rest that remains for God's people"],
    author: "Anonymous. The author is not named. Early candidates include Paul (Tertullian), Apollos (Luther), Barnabas, Priscilla, and Luke. The style and vocabulary differ significantly from Paul's letters, though the theology is Pauline.",
    dating: "Before 70 AD — the Temple and its sacrifices are described as ongoing present realities, which would be an extraordinary omission had it already fallen.",
    evidence: [
      "The letter was known to Clement of Rome (c. 96 AD), who quotes it extensively in 1 Clement — confirming its circulation and authority by the end of the 1st century.",
      "Clement of Alexandria (in Eusebius, EH 6.14.4) suggested Paul wrote it in Hebrew and Luke translated it.",
      "Origen (in Eusebius, EH 6.25.11–14): 'The thoughts are the apostle's, but the language and composition belong to one who wrote down what the apostle said... Who wrote the epistle, God truly knows.'"

  James: {
    summary: "James is the most practical NT letter — a Jewish-Christian wisdom book addressing the gap between faith and works. Written by the Lord's own brother, it calls believers to genuine faith expressed in caring for the poor, taming the tongue, and patient endurance.",
    themes: ["Faith without works is dead", "Wisdom from above versus worldly wisdom", "The power and danger of the tongue", "Care for the poor as pure religion", "Patient endurance under trial"],
    author: "James the Just, brother of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem church (1:1; cf. Gal. 1:19; Acts 15). His martyrdom is recorded by Josephus (Antiquities 20.9.1).",
    dating: "c. 45–50 AD — among the earliest NT letters, before the Jerusalem Council (49 AD).",
    evidence: [
      "Josephus (Antiquities 20.9.1) records the martyrdom of 'James the brother of Jesus who was called Christ' in 62 AD — confirming his historical existence and prominence.",
      "Eusebius (EH 2.23) records detailed accounts of James's ministry and death, drawing on Hegesippus.",
      "Origen and Eusebius both acknowledge some disputed its canonicity early, but it was widely received and cited."

  '1 Peter': {
    summary: "1 Peter is written to scattered Christians facing persecution — 'elect exiles' — calling them to holy living, submission to authorities, and joyful endurance of suffering. Peter interprets their suffering through the lens of Christ's own suffering and resurrection, pointing forward to the 'unfading inheritance.'",
    themes: ["Suffering as participation in Christ's sufferings", "Holy living in exile", "The precious cornerstone — Christ as the foundation", "Hope as the anchor of endurance", "The priesthood of all believers"],
    author: "Peter the Apostle (1:1), writing from 'Babylon' (Rome). Early church tradition unanimously confirms Petrine authorship.",
    dating: "c. 62–65 AD, from Rome, shortly before Peter's martyrdom under Nero.",
    evidence: [
      "Polycarp of Smyrna (Epistle to the Philippians, c. 110 AD) quotes 1 Peter multiple times, confirming its early circulation and Petrine authority.",
      "Clement of Rome (1 Clement, c. 96 AD) reflects knowledge of 1 Peter.",
      "Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria all cite 1 Peter as Petrine.",
      "The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170–200 AD) is damaged at this point but later lists confirm its canonical status.",
      "The letter's Greek quality (noted by critics) is easily explained by Silvanus as Peter's amanuensis (5:12)."

    sources: ["Polycarp, Epistle to the Philippians (multiple quotations)", "Clement of Rome, 1 Clement", "Irenaeus, Against Heresies 4.9.2", "Muratorian Fragment"]
  },

  '2 Peter': {
    summary: "2 Peter is Peter's final letter, written in the face of his approaching martyrdom. It warns against false teachers who will arise, defends the reality of Christ's return against scoffers, and calls believers to grow in grace and knowledge. Its relationship to Jude and questions about authorship make it one of the NT's most discussed books.",
    themes: ["Growing in grace and knowledge", "The divine authority of Scripture — prophecy not of private interpretation", "Warning against false teachers and their destruction", "The Day of the Lord — cosmic judgment and new creation", "Patience in awaiting Christ's return"],
    author: "Peter the Apostle (1:1). Disputed more than almost any NT letter, but defended as genuinely Petrine by strong evidence.",
    dating: "c. 65–68 AD, from Rome, just before Peter's martyrdom under Nero.",
    evidence: [
      "Peter explicitly claims eyewitness testimony of the Transfiguration (1:16–18) — a claim that would be fraudulent and easily refuted if written by someone else in the 2nd century.",
      "The letter's reference to 'this is now the second letter I have written to you' (3:1) directly links it to 1 Peter and the same audience.",
      "Origen (3rd century) acknowledged 2 Peter as disputed but leaned toward its acceptance; Eusebius placed it among the 'disputed but known' books — disputed in some churches, accepted in others, not rejected outright.",
      "The difference in Greek style from 1 Peter is explained by the use of different secretaries (Silvanus in 1 Pet. 5:12; no secretary named in 2 Peter — Peter may have written more directly given his impending death).",
      "The content and theology are consistent with what we know of Peter's preaching in Acts: the Transfiguration, the coming judgment, patience.",
      "By the time of Athanasius's canonical list (367 AD) and the Councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397), 2 Peter was universally received as canonical.",
      "The so-called 'Petrine school' theory (pseudonymous writing in Peter's name) was a dishonest practice that Peter himself explicitly condemns: 'we did not follow cleverly devised myths' (1:16)."

  '1 John': {
    summary: "1 John is a pastoral letter testing genuine Christianity: do you believe that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh? Do you walk in the light? Do you love the brothers? These three tests — doctrinal, moral, and relational — run through the letter. It was written to counter early Gnostic/Docetic teaching.",
    themes: ["God is light — walking in the light", "God is love — loving one another", "The incarnation of Jesus is non-negotiable", "Assurance of salvation: 'that you may know'", "Overcoming the world through faith"],

    sources: ["Polycarp (who knew John personally)", "Irenaeus, Against Heresies (multiple citations)", "Clement of Alexandria"]
  },

  '2 John': {
    summary: "2 John is a brief letter from 'the Elder' to a 'chosen lady and her children' (likely a local church), warning against receiving false teachers (Docetists who denied Christ's incarnation) and calling for love and obedience to the original apostolic teaching.",

  },

  '3 John': {
    summary: "3 John is the shortest NT book — a personal letter from 'the Elder' to Gaius, commending him for his hospitality to traveling missionaries, rebuking the domineering Diotrephes, and commending Demetrius. It offers a glimpse into real early church conflicts.",
    themes: ["Walking in the truth", "Hospitality as gospel partnership", "The abuse of church authority (Diotrephes)", "Faithful witness building the church"],

  Jude: {
    summary: "Jude is a short but fierce letter warning against false teachers who had crept into the church — people who 'turn the grace of our God into a license for immorality.' Jude urges believers to 'contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints' (v. 3).",

    dating: "c. 65–80 AD. The relationship to 2 Peter (Jude 4–13 parallels 2 Peter 2:1–18) is widely noted; most scholars believe Jude preceded 2 Peter.",
    sources: ["Clement of Alexandria, Hypotyposes (comments on Jude)", "Tertullian, De cultu feminarum (cites Jude)", "Origen (accepts Jude's authority)"]
  },

  Revelation: {
    summary: "Revelation is the NT's great prophetic-apocalyptic book — a vision given to John of Jesus Christ's ultimate victory over Satan, the Beast, and Death. Through vivid imagery drawn heavily from the OT prophets, it encourages persecuted believers that the Lamb who was slain is now the King of kings, and that history is moving toward the new creation.",
    themes: ["The sovereignty of the Lamb over all history", "Worship — the proper response to divine revelation", "Persecution, martyrdom, and ultimate vindication", "The final defeat of Satan, the Beast, and Death", "The new creation — God dwelling with his people forever"],
    author: "John the Apostle (1:1, 9; 22:8), by the strongest early tradition. Justin Martyr (c. 150 AD) is the first to explicitly name John the Apostle as the author.",
    dating: "c. 95–96 AD, during the reign of Domitian (Irenaeus's testimony). An earlier date (c. 64–68 AD, Nero's reign) is held by some scholars based on internal evidence.",

      "Irenaeus (Against Heresies 5.30.3): 'For that was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian's reign' — placing composition c. 95–96 AD and affirming Apostolic authorship.",
