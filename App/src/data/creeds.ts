    historicalNotes:
      'The earliest form of this creed—the Old Roman Symbol—was used as a baptismal interrogation (question-and-answer) in Rome by the 2nd century. Its articles directly counter Gnostic denials: "Creator of heaven and earth" (against the evil Demiurge), "born of the Virgin Mary" and "suffered under Pontius Pilate" (against Docetism\'s phantom Christ), "resurrection of the body" (against the Gnostic rejection of material creation). The creed was never defined by an ecumenical council but achieved universal acceptance in the Western church.',

    historicalNotes:
      'Convened by Emperor Constantine to settle the Arian controversy. The key word homoousios ("of one substance") was championed by Bishop Alexander of Alexandria and his deacon Athanasius. Arius taught that the Son was the first and greatest creature—"there was a time when he was not." The council condemned this with a near-unanimous vote (reportedly only 2 bishops refusing to sign). The anathemas at the end are part of the original 325 text; the later 381 creed dropped them. Athanasius spent the next decades defending homoousios, suffering five exiles—hence "Athanasius contra mundum" (Athanasius against the world).',

    historicalNotes:
      'This is the creed recited in liturgy worldwide today—what most Christians call "the Nicene Creed" is technically this 381 expansion. The council addressed two gaps left at Nicaea: (1) Apollinarianism (Christ lacked a human soul) and (2) Macedonianism—the "Spirit-fighters" who accepted the Son\'s divinity but denied the Spirit\'s. The greatly expanded third article ("the Lord and Giver of Life… worshipped and glorified with the Father and Son") directly countered this. The controversial Filioque ("and the Son") clause—affirming that the Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son—was added by Western churches by the 6th century and became a central cause of the Great Schism (1054).',

    historicalNotes:
      'The four adverbs—"unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably"—are the theological heart of Chalcedon. The first two ("unconfusedly, unchangeably") exclude Eutychianism: the two natures are not blended or absorbed into one. The last two ("indivisibly, inseparably") exclude Nestorianism: the two natures are not split into two separate persons. The council also affirmed Mary as Theotokos (God-bearer), repudiating Nestorius\'s preferred Christotokos. Three major Eastern churches (Oriental Orthodox: Coptic, Ethiopian, Armenian) rejected Chalcedon as Nestorian and remain non-Chalcedonian to this day, though modern ecumenical dialogue has largely resolved the underlying theological differences as terminological.',

    historicalNotes:
      'Despite being named after Athanasius of Alexandria (d. 373), modern scholarship is unanimous that he did not write it—it is Latin in origin, and Athanasius wrote in Greek. It was likely composed in southern Gaul c. 500 AD. The creed is unique in its opening and closing damnatory clauses ("whosoever will be saved… without doubt he shall perish everlastingly"), making it the most precise and demanding of the three ecumenical creeds. It was widely used in Western liturgy from the 9th century. The creed systematically enumerates every Trinitarian and Christological error, combining elements refuted at Nicaea (Arianism), Constantinople (Macedonianism, Apollinarianism), Ephesus (Nestorianism), and Chalcedon (Eutychianism).',
